Overview
--------------

In light of the Blackjack Solitaire game that we designed in project 3, our group developed a 2-dimensional Pac-Man game,
in which the player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the "dots" and avoid the "ghosts" within enclosed mazes.
If Pac-Man makes contact with the ghosts, he will lose a life and the game ends if Pac-Man loses all his lives.

This game features multiple game levels. The player advances through the game levels aiming to score as high as
possible before running out of lives. In addition to the main game state, the game also has game over state when
the game ends after the Pac-Man runs out of lives and the high score state to view history high scores.
